# Lab 2
<!-- # Part 2: Intelligent IVR -->

In this lab, we will learn how traditional Dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) flows can be transformed into intelligent and personalized interactions using text-to-speech and dynamic data.

We will discover how Cisco's text-to-speech capability can enhance the customer experience by personalizing interactions within flows. Then, we will elevate these flows by integrating virtual agents in a subsequent lab.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, attendees will:

- Understand the core components of Flow Designer that enable the construction of traditional and next-generation IVR flows.
- Transform traditional flows using text-to-speech to enhance the call path and introduce personalization through data.
- Learn how data is exchanged between Webex Contact Center and third-party systems, using example APIs.

**Pre-requisites**

- You have received the access credentials with a contact center administrator access.

- Your Attendee ID will be used as the login in all the web pages, in the format: `wxcclabs+admin_ID***@gmail.com`

| **User Role** | **User Login Credentials**                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Administrator | wxcclabs+admin_ID<w class = "attendee_out">attendeeID</w>@gmail.com |

## Step 1: Understand and Verify the Existing Flow

- Log into Control Hub with your Administrator User - wxcclabs+admin_ID<w class = "attendee_out">attendeeID</w>@gmail.com

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/1.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Verify that an entry point named `CL_EP_`<w class = "attendee_out">attendeeID</w> exists in the system,  where <w class = "attendee_out">attendeeID</w> is your attendeeID. Make sure to take a note of the support Number assigned to your entry point. This will the number you dial in to make test call.

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/2.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Ensure that a team has been created for you in the format `CL_Team_`<w class = "attendee_out">attendeeID</w>.

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/999.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Check that a queue named `CL_Q_`<w class = "attendee_out">attendeeID</w> exists, where <w class = "attendee_out">attendeeID</w> is your attendeeID
- Verify that your team `CL_Team_`<w class = "attendee_out">attendeeID</w> is part of the Queue. This ensures that your agent can receive calls via this queue using the Longest Available Agent (LAA) routing.

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/4.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Copy the existing flow template `CL_LTRCCT_2006_SimpleFlow`.

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/5.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Rename the flow with your pod number as `CL_SimpleFlow_`<w class = "attendee_out">attendeeID</w>  where <w class = "attendee_out">attendeeID</w> is your attendeeID.

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/6.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Explore the flow and understand the node configurations. The flow includes a simple welcome message among others.

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/7.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Change the Queue Assigned in the Queue Contact Activity to your Attendee ID Queue - `CL_Q_`<w class = "attendee_out">attendeeID</w>  where <w class = "attendee_out">attendeeID</w> is your attendeeID

- Validate the flow by clicking "Validate" and then "Publish" the Flow.

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/8.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Assign the Flow to your Channel (Entry Point) - Do this by first going to Channel > Search for your channel `CL_Q_`<w class = "attendee_out">attendeeID</w>  where <w class = "attendee_out">attendeeID</w> is your attendeeID
- Select the Latest version of the flow > Click Save.

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/9.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Click "Save".

- Make a test call by calling the Support Number provided, which is configured in your Channel Configuration.

- Reopen the flow designer by choosing your Flow > `CL_`<w class = "attendee_out">attendeeID</w>`_SimpleFlow`  where <w class = "attendee_out">attendeeID</w> is your attendeeID

- Open the debug view and explore the call path and the steps taken in the flow.

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/10.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Note that the interaction ID uniquely identifies the flow and assists in debugging.

> To Login the Agent and Receive the call verify the following Settings

- Confirm that your agent user is configured with a Site as `CL_Site`, Team  as `CL_Team_`<w class = "attendee_out">attendeeID</w>, and Multimedia profile as `Default_Multimedia_Profile`.

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/11.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Open the Agent Desktop URL with a correct Chrome Profile: **[https://desktop.wxcc-us1.cisco.com](https://desktop.wxcc-us1.cisco.com){:target="\_blank"}**

- Choose the Correct Team `CL_Team_`<w class = "attendee_out">attendeeID</w> corresponding to your POD number and sign in With the Desktop Option.

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/12.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Go to an available state to receive the call once you have called into the Queue.

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/13.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Notice all the variables on the Agent Desktop when you get the call.

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/14.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

## Step 2: Transform the Flow with Text-to-Speech

> In this section, we will use the same flow, and convert all the media activities to use Cisco Text to Speech.

- Follow the steps in the GIF below to replace your welcome prompt from using Audio file to  text-to-speech. Enable the Cisco text-to-speech and enter the welcome message you want played, for example, "Welcome to Cisco Live!"

Welcome Prompt: `Welcome to Cisco Live!`

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/15.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Follow this by now requesting for the 3 digit attendee ID.

Collect Digit Prompt: `Press Enter your 3 digit attendee ID followed by pound.`

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/16.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Now edit the Play Message connected to the collect digit activity as well - you can experiment with any text.

Prompt: `Thanks. Please hold while we find you an expert.`

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/17_1.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Feel free to Modify the Comfort message while in Queue as well by changing the prompt in Play message activity connected to the play music activity

Prompt: `Thank you for waiting. Please Hold while we get you an expert.`

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/17_2.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Validate and publish the flow.

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/8.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Make another test call to the same DN by dialing the number - and notice the change in the prompts, which are now using text-to-speech.

## Step 3: Add Intelligent Data for Personalization

- In the global flow properties section, click on `Add Flow Variable`. Create the following variables in the flow:

  - Name: `customerName`
  - Type: `String`
  - Default value: `Alice`
  - Label: `Customer Name`
  - Secure: `No`
  - Make Agent viewable

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/19.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Name: `accountId`
- Type: `String`
- Default value: `12345678`
- Label: `Customer Account ID`
- Secure: `No`
- Make Agent viewable

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/20.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

Similarly, create three other variables as mentioned below: `pin` , `invoice`, `email` with default placeholder values.

---

- Name: `pin`
- Type: `String`
- Default Value: `1001`
- Label: `Customer PIN`
- Secure: `Yes`
- `Don't make this agent viewable or editable`

---

- Name: `invoice`
- Type: `Decimal`
- Default Value: `100.00`
- Label: `Customer Invoice Amount`
- Secure: `Yes`
- Make Agent viewable

---

- Name: `email`
- Type: `String`
- Default Value: `customer@cisco.com`
- Label: `Customer Email`
- Secure: `Yes`
- Make Agent viewable

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/21.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Replace the welcome prompt with data using the example below to personalize prompts based on dynamic data. Initially, youâ€™ll hear the default values which are hardcoded into the variable values.

Welcome Prompt: `Hello {{ customerName }}, Welcome to Cisco Live!`

Collect Digit Prompt: `We noticed you have an account with us with account ID {{accountId}} and outstanding invoice amount of {{ invoice }}. Press Enter your 3 digit Pin followed by pound to confirm the payment.`

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/22.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Validate and publish the flow.

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/8.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Make a test call by dialing the DN assigned to your POD.

> Open the "Debug" pane to analyze the call path and interaction details - you will notice that the variables are now used to personalize the IVR with Text to speech injecting with custom data.

## Step 4: Use a Data Dip with HTTP

> We will use the following Mock API to personalize the IVR. Assume that this is a Mock CRM storing Customer data.
> URL: **[https://60ef3435f587af00179d3960.mockapi.io/api/tickets](https://60ef3435f587af00179d3960.mockapi.io/api/tickets){:target="\_blank"}**
> The next steps in the lab will basically help configure the HTTP activity to retrieve caller information and use SSML to tailor the experience using Cisco Cloud Text To Speech

> **Modify the existing "Collect Digits" activity on the canvas.**

- Set up the prompt to ask for the caller's account number. Use a prompt like:

  `Welcome {{customerName}} to Cisco Live! Please enter your 8-digit account number followed by pound.`

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/23.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Configure the minimum and maximum digits to 8 - instead of the previously 3.

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/24.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Note the output variable of the "Collect Digits" node and copy it to clipboard.

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/24_1.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Drag the "Set Variable" activity and set the flow variable `accountId` to the "Collect Digits" output variable using the example provided.

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/25.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Connect it after the Collect Digits Activity.

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/25_1.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Drag the "HTTP Request" activity from the palette to the beginning of the canvas and rename it to "DataDip".

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/26.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Connect it in the middle of the `Set Variable` and `Play Prompt` activities.

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/27.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Configure the "HTTP Request" activity with the following settings:

Use Authenticated endpoint = False

Request URL = `https://60ef3435f587af00179d3960.mockapi.io/api/tickets`

Method = `GET`

Query Parameters
Key Value
accountId `{{accountId}}`

Content Type = `application/JSON`

Response Timeout = `2000 ms`

Number of retries = `3`

Parse Settings -

Content Type = `JSON`

Output Variables

invoice = `$.[0].invoice`

email = `$.[0].reportee`

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/28.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Modify the existing Play Prompt step and play back the dynamic information and tailor it using SSML

- Enable Cisco Text to Speech and use the following syntax

```
Thanks! It seems like you have an issue with your billing. We just found a pending Invoice of {{invoice}}. We will send you a confirmation email to {{email}} after connecting you to the best representative for your problem.
```

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/29.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Make a Test Call.

- Optionally, Debug and follow along the flow.

- Now Transform this text using SSML to see the difference:

```xml
<speak>
    Thanks!
    <break time="300ms"/>
    It seems like you have an issue with your billing.
    <break time="300ms"/>
    We just found a pending Invoice of
    <say-as interpret-as="currency">${{invoice}}</say-as>.
    <break time="300ms"/>
    We will send you a confirmation email to
    <say-as interpret-as="email">{{email}}</say-as>
    <break time="300ms"/>
    after connecting you to the best representative for your problem.
</speak>
```

<img align="middle" src="../images/lab2/30.gif" width="1000" />  
<br/>
<br/>

- Make another test call. Use Debugging to follow the flow along.
