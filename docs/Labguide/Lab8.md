# LAB 8 (Bonus): Autonomous Agents  

## 8.1: Overview

We discuss Autonomous agents presentation 


## 8.1: Prototype: What to expect and whatâ€™s new

<!-- md:option type:note -->
!!! note "Step objective"
    We will dive into the differences between what has changed and what remains the same 


We have 2 broad classes of agents: **`Autonomous`** and **`Scripted`** 

Agents that we are using so far Q&A bot and Task bot that fall under scripted agents we are now introducing Autonomous agents that used GenAI 

When you create a new agent and when you select Start from Scratch, you will see the below enhanced view

<br/>


Step 1: **What type of agent are you building?**

- You will promoted to pick between ** `Autonomous`** and **`Scripted`**

<!-- md:option type:note -->
!!! note "Defining the terms"

    Autonomous: Used generative AI to create dynamics responses 

    Scripted: Uses natural language processing to follow your set logic and responses 


Step 2: **What's your agents main function?**

You can choose between **`Answer questions`** and **`Perform actions`** depending on what the agent's main function is 

<!-- md:option type:note -->
!!! note "Defining the terms"
    
    **Answer questions:** Delivers answers using information from knowledge base 

    **Perform actions:** Automated tasks in response to customer requests 

**Scripted: Linking the old with the new**

If you choose Scripted - it is similar to the Q&A and Task bot that is currently present in production
