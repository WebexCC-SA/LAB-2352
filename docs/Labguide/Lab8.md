## 8.1: Prototype: What to expect and whatâ€™s new

 ![Login](../images/AI/1.gif)

- We have 2 broad classes of agents 

Agents that we are using so far Q&A bot and Task bot that fall under scripted agents we are not introducing Autonomous agents that used GenAI 

When you try to create a new agent and when you select Start from Scratch 


What type of agent are you building? 

you will now get to pick between Autonomous and Scripted 

Autonomous: Used generative AI to create dynamics responses 

Scripted: Uses natural language processing to follow your set logic and responses 


What's your agents main function?

and you can choose between Answer questions and Perform actions depending on what the agent's main function is 
Answer questions: Delivers answers using information from knowledge base 
Perform actions: Automates tasks in response to customer requests
