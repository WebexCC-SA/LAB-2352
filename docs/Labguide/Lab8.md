# LAB 8 (Bonus): Future Agent and Supervisor sign in

## 8.1: Overview

New Webex Contact Center Desktop Sign-in with Streamlined Station Credentials

To streamline the agent and supervisor sign-in process, we will enhance the Webex Contact Center station credentials dialog for users. This feature aims to eliminate friction, improve efficiency, and enhance the overall user experience for both agents and supervisors.

This lab is designed to give you a **basic understanding of the new experience** and all you to **experience it first-hand**. You will be using a working prototype to complete the steps in this lab.


## 8.2: Prototype: What to expect and what’s new

- Simplified Sign-In Process:
•	Webex Contact Center Single sign-on (SSO) for both agents and supervisors.
•	New user-friendly dialog design and field copy
•	Skip voice credential input during sign-in for digital-only deployments.
    

- Save Station Credential Selections for Future Sign-ins:
•	Unnecessary information fields during sign-in are removed from the dialog (requires admin set up of user telephony options to be configured).
•	Users can save their selection/preferences and skip the station credential dialog for subsequent sign-ins.
•	Users can change their selection/preferences at any time post-sign in from the avatar menu>Change Profile Settings (at the top right-hand corner of Desktop).
•	Agents can select their team upon sign-in to determine the appropriate layout, routing, and generating relevant reports.

## 8.3: Prototype: What to expect and what’s new

1.	Click the email dialog and enter email and password to log in
2.	When prompted with the station credentials dialog,
    a.	Click the drop down for **Handle calls using** and select “Extension”
    b.	Click the drop down for **Extension** and select “302”
    c.	**Your team** will be pre-populated as “Debit card”
    d.	**Save preferences to Profile Settings** will be checked by default
3.	**Confirm** your selection
4.	**Click on the avatar menu** to review your selections in **Change Profile Settings**

      

## 8.4: Review user value

This new experience will help solve key friction points when signing in. Because a user’s selection can be saved for future sign ins, it will reduce time, errors, and the number of repetitive steps required at sign in.

**Congratulations, you have completed this lab! You can continue with the next one.**
