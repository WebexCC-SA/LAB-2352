# LAB 8 (Bonus): Autonomous Agents  

## Overview

We discuss Autonomous agents presentation 


## 8.1: Prototype: What to expect and whatâ€™s new

<!-- md:option type:note -->
!!! note "Step objective"
    We will dive into the differences between what has changed and what remains the same 


We have 2 broad classes of agents: **`Autonomous`** and **`Scripted`** 

Agents that we are using so far Q&A bot and Task bot that fall under scripted agents and now we are introducing Autonomous agents that uses GenAI 

When you create a new agent and select Start from Scratch, you will see the below enhanced view

<br/>
<br/>


Step 1: Define **What type of agent are you building?**

You will prompted to pick between **`Autonomous`** and **`Scripted`**

<!-- md:option type:note -->
!!! note "Defining the terms"

    **Autonomous:** Uses generative AI to create dynamics responses 

    **Scripted:** Uses natural language processing to follow your set logic and responses 


Step 2: **What's your agents main function?**

You can choose between **`Answer questions`** and **`Perform actions`** depending on what the agent's main function is 

<!-- md:option type:note -->
!!! note "Defining the terms"
    
    **Answer questions:** Delivers answers using information from knowledge base 

    **Perform actions:** Automated tasks in response to customer requests 

## 8.2 Scripted Agents: Linking the old with the new

<!-- md:option type:note -->
!!! note "Step objective"
    We look at how Scripted Agents ties back to what is currently present in production 

If you choose Scripted - it is similar to the **`Q&A Bot`** and **`Task bot`** that is currently present in production

<br/>

Log in to the Control Hub using the contact center `admin` credentials.

Go to Contact Center from the left side navigation panel, and under Quick Links, click on `Webex AI Agent`

<br/>
<br/>

If you select Scripted and the Answer questions we will be redirected to the **`Q&A Bot`** page:

<br/>
<br/>

If you select Scripted and the Answer questions we will be redirected to the **`Task bot`** page:

## 8.3 Autonomous Agents: Whats new? 

<!-- md:option type:note -->
!!! note "Step objective"
    The Autonomous AI Agent for performing actions can handle various tasks, including:

    Natural Language Processing (NLP)â€”Understand and respond to human language in a natural and conversational manner.

    Decision makingâ€”Make informed choices based on available information and predefined rules. Automationâ€”Automate repetitive or time-consuming tasks


<!-- md:option type:warning -->
!!! warning "Guide"

Autonomous Agents are showcased in the demo session at WebexOne

Step by step guide are provided here: [Autonomous Agents](../images/lab8/3.pdf)
